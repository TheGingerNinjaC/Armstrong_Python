# Armstrong_Python

An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of
the nth powers of its individual digits.

Write a Python program to accept as input an integer from the user and
passes the integer to a function, Armstrong(), which determines whether
the number is an Armstrong number or not.

The Armstrong() function should accept an integer, determine whether
the number is an Armstrong number or not, and returns a 1 (true) or
0 (false) to the calling statement in the main program.
